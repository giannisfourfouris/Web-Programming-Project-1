            <p>NVIDIA Jetson Nano is an embedded system-on-module (SoM) and developer kit from the NVIDIA
                Jetson family, including an integrated 128-core Maxwell GPU, quad-core ARM A57 64-bit CPU, 4GB LPDDR4
                memory, along with support for MIPI CSI-2 and PCIe Gen2 high-speed I/O.
                <br><br>Useful for deploying computer vision
                and deep learning for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech
                processing, Jetson Nano runs Linux and provides 472 GFLOPS of FP16 compute performance with 5-10W of
                power consumption. Jetson Nano has the performance and capabilities needed to run modern AI workloads
                fast, making it possible to add advanced AI to any product. It brings AI to a world of new embedded and
                IOT
                applications, including entry-level network video recorders (NVRs), home robots, and intelligent
                gateways with full
                analytics capabilities. The SDK also includes the ability to natively install popular open source
                Machine Learning (ML) frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Keras, and MXNet, along with
                frameworks for
                computer vision and robotics development like OpenCV and ROS.
                Full compatibility with these frameworks
                and NVIDIAâ€™s leading AI platform makes it easier than ever to deploy AI-based inference workloads to
                Jetson.
                <br><br>Jetson Nano brings real-time computer vision and inferencing across a wide variety of complex
                Deep
                Neural Network (DNN) models. These capabilities enable multi-sensor autonomous robots, IoT devices with
                intelligent edge analytics, and advanced AI systems. Even transfer learning is possible for re-training
                networks
                locally onboard Jetson Nano using the ML frameworks.</p>
